      <h1>Power Symbol 1973</h1>
      <p>The power symbol is the brilliant result of evolving technology. Originally, power controls and binary switches were denoted with the words on and off. As technology evolved, the words were replaced with the line "I" for "on" and circle "O" for "off," meaning a closed electrical circuit (device on) and an open circuit (device off). In 1973, these two symbols were combined into one icon, initially referred to as "standby." Thirty years later, an international committee of scientists and engineers recommended that this combined symbol should stand for its more commonly accepted understanding: power.</p>
