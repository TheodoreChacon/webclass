    <h3>I'm Wally</h3>
    <p>I was born in the United Kingdom by English illustrator <em>Martin Handford</em>, and ever since then, I've been traveling all around the world, hiding in the most crowded, chaotic places you can imagine.<br><br> I never go anywhere without my red-and-white striped shirt, blue jeans, and my trusty bobble hat. People say I'm really good at blending in, but I bet <strong>you</strong> can't find me!<br><br> So, Spotter... ready for the challenge? Let's see if your eyes are as sharp as you think they are!</p>
    <h3>Rules:</h3>
    <p>-Click on Wally when you spot him to unlock the next level.</p>
    <p>-Click the wrong place, and it's Game Over. You'll start again!</p>
    <p>-Beat all 4 levels to become the Ultimate Wally Finder!</p>
    <h3 class="beat">Are you ready to begin your search?</h3>
